                    <h2>Built in the Trenches, Not Boardrooms</h2>
                    <p class="bio-intro">I didn't learn scaling from textbooks. I learned it by doing—building, breaking, and rebuilding operational systems for companies at every stage from seed to exit.</p>
                    
                    <p>My career started in the chaos of early-stage startups. I was employee #8 at a SaaS company that went from $500K to $25M ARR in four years. I saw what worked, what broke, and what had to be completely rebuilt at each inflection point.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then I joined a PE-backed firm as Head of Operations, tasked with scaling five portfolio companies simultaneously. That's where I developed the frameworks I use today—repeatable systems for revenue operations, team structure, and strategic planning that work across industries.</p>
                    
                    <p>After a decade on the operator side, I realized my real value was in the architecture—designing the infrastructure companies need to scale predictably. So I founded AKcelerate.</p>

                    <h3>Systems Over Strategy Decks</h3>
                    <p>Most consultants give you a beautiful PowerPoint and disappear. I build the actual systems with you—process documentation, team playbooks, operational workflows. Real infrastructure, not just ideas.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Embedded, Not Advisory</h3>
                    <p>I don't work from an office downtown. I embed with your team, sit in your meetings, and understand the real bottlenecks. You can't architect solutions from the outside.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Execution, Not Just Planning</h3>
                    <p>Strategy is worthless without execution. I stay through implementation—training your team, optimizing workflows, and ensuring systems actually work in practice, not just in theory.</p>

                    <p>I work with 3-5 companies at a time. Not because I'm exclusive, but because embedded work requires deep attention. Quality over quantity, always.</p>

                <p>When I'm not architecting growth systems, you'll find me trail running in the Rockies, tinkering with automation tools (I automate everything), or teaching operational strategy at a local accelerator.</p>
